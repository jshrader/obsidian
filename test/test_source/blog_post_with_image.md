A surprise: the age of mothers at the time of childbirth has been non-monotonic over the last few decades such that it is now just about equal to what it was ~100 years ago. This is especially clear in Sweden, which has long-running and high-quality records:

The explanation comes from the fact that this is age at time of childbirth for all children, not just the first child. Number of children per woman is falling at the same time that age for first child is rising. Still surprising that these forces are so exactly cancelling out right at this moment. 

Data for all countries (which don't all exhibit that same pattern) can be found [here](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/period-average-age-of-mothers).
