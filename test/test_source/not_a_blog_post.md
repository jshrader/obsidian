One of the clearest forms of human progress is the reduction in infant and child mortality. But I hadn't appreciated just how recent, widespread, and fast this progress has been until reading [this article from Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality-in-the-past).

Consistently across the world, mortality for children under the age of 15 was 40 to 60% all the way until 1900. Then is dropped to 4.3% globally within 120 years, with the majority of this drop occurring since 1950. And the highest rate now is only around 15%, though that is still shockingly high compared to the <1% rates observed in some countries.
